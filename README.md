Jarvis-RAG is a simple personal AI assistant built using a Streamlit chat interface, Pinecone vector database for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a self-hosted language model (phi3) running locally through Ollama. It retrieves the most relevant stored knowledge from Pinecone based on the user’s query and then generates a contextual response using the phi3 model.
